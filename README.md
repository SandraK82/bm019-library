# bm019-library

Library project to interface a bm019 module ( http://www.solutions-cubed.com/bm019/ ) (based on ST Micro CR95HF NFC interface chip ( http://www2.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/memories/nfc-rfid-memories-and-transceivers/nfc-rfid-transceivers/cr95hf.html ) ).

This is a work in progress project where i will add functions and support if needed.

The primary function is to drive an arduino, esp8266, or nRF51 based nfc to serial, wifi, or ble systems in conjuction with an open reader library for the Abbott Freestyle NFC based flash clucose measurement system. (more projects will appear soon)

This Library can be included via mbed: https://developer.mbed.org/users/SandraK/code/BLE-bm019-spi/
